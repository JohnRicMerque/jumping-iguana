# jumping-iguana
A simple alternate to the jumping dinosaur game on browser. This project is done to practice my learning on CSS animations, CSS variables, HTML and basic JavaScript.

# DISCLAIMER
This project was referenced to KnifeCircus Youtube Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ) but I did some slight modifications and implemented variables. This project was done for learning purposes only, I do not claim ownership of the algorithm pattern implemented in this project.
